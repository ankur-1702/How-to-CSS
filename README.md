# How-to-CSS
This repository contains five minor frontend projects and one major project — an Instagram clone — created to practice and showcase my skills in HTML, CSS.  
Each project focuses on different aspects of modern web design including layouts, responsive design, styling, and user interface elements.  
The Instagram clone project demonstrates more advanced concepts like flexible grids, navigation bars, profiles, and feed sections.  
All designs are clean, styled using only CSS without relying on any external CSS frameworks.
